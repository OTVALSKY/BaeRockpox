Tired mashing A+D, because of rockpox 100 times per mission? 
Fear not, brother, Otvalsky got ya! 

This script is designed to get rid of annoying Pockpox stun mechanic, 
by replacing button mashing with simple "hold to get free" action. 
Script can be configured to use Mouse4 or Mouse 5 buttons (mouse 5 being default), 
or custom keyboard key.
